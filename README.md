Promptizer is a Next.js project that is both a portfolio website and a collection of commonly used AI tools and third-party products. It is designed to help developers in their daily work by providing them with a single place to access a variety of useful resources.

The AI tools included in Promptizer include:

DALL-E 2: A text-to-image diffusion model that can generate realistic images from text descriptions.
GPT-3: A large language model that can generate text, translate languages, write different kinds of creative content, and answer your questions in an informative way.
Imagen: A text-to-image diffusion model that can generate photorealistic images from text descriptions.
In addition to AI tools, Promptizer also includes a variety of third-party products, such as:

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework that helps you to build responsive and beautiful websites quickly and easily.
React Hook Form: A library that makes it easy to build forms in React.
Axios: A popular HTTP client library for JavaScript.
Promptizer is an open-source project, which means that anyone can contribute to its development or use it for their own projects. It is also free to use, so there is no barrier to entry.

Here are some of the ways that Promptizer can be used by developers:
